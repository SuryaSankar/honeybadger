(a) The following data refer to the dimensions of the links of a four bar mechanism. AB=50 mm; BC = 66 mm; CD = 56 mm; and AD (fixed link) = 100 mm. At the instant when $\angle DAB=60^{\circ}$, the link AB has an angular velocity of 10.5 rad/s in the counter clockwise direction. Determine the velocity of point C, velocity of point E on the link BC while BE=40mm and the angular velocities of the links BC and CD. Also sketch the mechanism and indicate the data. (16)
(b) A single slider crank mechanism is shown in the figure below. Determine the acceleration at B and E and the angular acceleration of the link AB. The crank rotates at 20 rad/s counter clockwise ![Fig1](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-ap-southeast-1-480790462509/question_images/ME2203/mayjun13/1.png) (16)

(a) A cam with a minimum radius of 25 mm, rotating clockwise at uniform speed of 300 rpm is to be designed to give motion to a flat faced mushroom follower as detailed below: (i) To raise through a distance of 25mm in $120^{\circ}$ rotation of the cam (ii) To remain at rest for the next $30^{\circ}$ (iii) To lower during further $120^{\circ}$ rotation of the cam. (iv) To remain in the same position during the rest of the revolution. The raising of the follower takes place with cycloidal motion and the lowering with uniform acceleration and retardation. Draw the displacement diagram and the profile of the cam (16)
(b) A circular cam operating a flat faced follower has a least diameter of 40 mm. The lift is 12 mm and angle of action is $160^{\circ}$. The speed of rotation is 500 rpm. If the period of acceleration of the follower is 60% of the retardation during the lift, determine the following (i) The principal dimensions of the cam (ii) The acceleration at the main points. Also determine the maximum acceleration and deceleration during the lift (16)
