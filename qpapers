(a) A drainage pump has tapered suction pipe. The pipe is running full of water. The pipe diameter at the inlet and at the upper end is 1 m and 0.5 m respectively. The free water surface is 2 m above the centre of the inlet and centre of upper end is 3 m above the top of free water surface.
The pressure at the top end of the pipe is 25 cm of Hg and it is known that loss of head by friction between top and bottom section is one tenth of the velocity head at the top section. Compute the discharge in litre/sec. Neglect loss of head at the entrance of the tapered pipe. (16)

(a) Explain what you understand by boundary layer thickness and displacement thickness. Determine the relationship between the two for a boundary layer which is laminar throughout and turbulent throughout. Assume in the laminar boundary layer, the flow obeys the law, shear stress \\[ \tau = \mu\frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{d} y} \\] where \\[ \mu \\] is the viscosity, which leads to velocity profile \\[ (U - u)=k(\delta -y)^2 \\] where U is the free stream velocity, u is the velocity at a distance y above the plate and k is a constant. The velocity distribution in the turbulent boundary layer is given by \\[ \frac{u}{U}=\left ( \frac{y}{\delta } \right )^\frac{1}{7} \\] (16)
