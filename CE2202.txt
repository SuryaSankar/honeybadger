(a) Integrate Euler's equation along a streamline in steady flow to obtain Bernoulli equation. State the restrictions on the use of Bernoulli equation (16)
(b) Explain any 2 applications of Bernoulli equation with suitable assumptions and derive suitable expressions to find the pressure drop and hence determine flow rate for each case (16)
14.
(a) Water flows at a rate of $0.0084 m^3/s$ through a 75 mm diameter smooth pipe with L=100m, attached to a constant level reservoir, with a square edged inlet. Find out the reservoir depth d to maintain the flow. The density and viscosity of water may be taken at standard temperature and pressure. The friction factor may be assumed as 0.0170 and the loss coefficient to be 0.5. The water discharges to the atmosphere. (16)
